# sqlalchemy_challenge

In this challenge, we were asked to do a climate analysis about Hawaii. We were to meant to do two things:

- Analyze and explore the climate date using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib
- Design a climate app using Flask API

This data is centered around temperature and precipitation between 2016 and 2017.
